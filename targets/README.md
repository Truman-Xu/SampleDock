## Targets
Two targets (retrieved from PDB) are supplied here as examples. 

The PDB structure has to be prepared by separating the ligand and the receptor into two files. 
The receptor has to be in *.mol2* file format, and ligand has to be in *.sd* format.
The *.grd*, *.as*, and *.prm* here are the example files generated by rdock program, `rbcavity`, for docking and pocket visualization. 
This `rbcavity` process will be automated by executing SampleDock's `sampler.py`, and will be saved at a different location (under the directory with the ouput designs) from the ligand and receptor files. 

For more information about running `rdock`, please consult: http://rdock.sourceforge.net/docking-in-3-steps/.
